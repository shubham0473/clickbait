  1. get_no_of_tokens() : Number of words in the headline
  2. get_avg_char_count() : Average number of characters in words (of headline)
  3. sd_len(): Length of syntactic dependency between governing & dependent words
    OUTPUT FORMAT in JSON:
      If there exists one syntactic dependency of length 2 and two of length 4, the output for a given headline would be [0, 0, 1, 0, 2]
      => The value at the corresponding index would be 1
      The maximum number of tokens in any headline is 19, so a list with 19 elements has been created.
